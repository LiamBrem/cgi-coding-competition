Tree + binary search

Not a binary tree

Leaf nodes value will be array of length 1

each other node.val = an array

the node returns the index of the element in the array of the sum of it's children

ex. parent.val = [1,2,3,4,5]
child1 returns 2
child2 returns 1
parent returns 2+1 = 3 at index = **2**

if it is a leaf node, it will just return the first and only element in its array
